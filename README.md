## Boilerplate for a flutter app

tabbed screens, action bar, state managed with provider, accessor class also handles syncing sharedprefs with backend database

## How to Use:

replace some of the basic info with your app's info, add your own screens and class names, add proper variables to your AppState and ActionState/ActionType, implement logic for accessor/modifier functions.

main.dart:
    - title
    - theme
    - app class name

screens/root.dart:
    - num tabs and classes for tabs


# TODO

example logic for loadState()
